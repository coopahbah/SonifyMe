Earthtunes: An application that sonifies and visualizes seismic data from around the world
Developed by Cooper Barth and Michael Ji, with original concept and advising from Professor Suzan van der Lee, and sonification idea from Professor Bryan Pardo. 

This project was developed as a component to a seismology outreach activity from Northwestern University's Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences,
with assistance from Lake County's Ryerson Conservation Area, Earthscope, the USGS, and Hanson Materials.

This project was funded by the Undergraduate Research Assistant Program (URAP) at Northwestern University

This project was made possible by the data web services offered by the IRIS Data Management Center, which is funded by the Nation Science Foundation.
